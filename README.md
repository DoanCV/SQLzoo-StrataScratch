## My SQLzoo solutions (pun intended)
This repository hosts some of my solutions to the problems on the SQLzoo.net site. I won't put quiz answers here as well as the trivial queries that either are already given or require minimal changes.

## MySQL StrataScratch solutions
I reliazed that there are not many SQL questions labeled "interview". Otherwise, there are plenty of problems which I will try to solve efficiently and post my solutions here. Once I run out of freemium problems, I will use my .edu account for the premium discount.


#### Note: All queries were written on the IDE next to the problems.
