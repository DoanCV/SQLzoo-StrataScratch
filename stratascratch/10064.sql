/* 
- We have three continents to work with so we will have to add the consumption together to get the total
    - combine original tables with union all, not just union to not lose rows
        - alias AS allEnergy
    - date, SUM(consumption) by each date FROM allEnergy
        - alias AS totalEnergy
    - SELECT MAX() FROM totalEnergy
        - alias as maxEnergy
- Select the date and max value FROM INNER JOIN ...
    - there can be ties so returning equal consumptions on different dates is expected
    - join the maxEnergy and totalEnergy

/*
--First iteration of my solution. 
--I realize a JOIN is not necessary as well as the maxEnergy table. 
--A nested select will also work since I am only looking for the max value anyways.
